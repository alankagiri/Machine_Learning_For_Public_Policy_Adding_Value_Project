# Machine Learning For Public Policy: Adding Value Project
Authors: Mburu Kagiri, Alice Lyu, Chris Strehl, Ashna Patel

# Objective
This project seeks to answer 2 main questions:
1. Are geographical features such as neighborhood, ward, or city predictive for certain types of 311 Requests?
2. How accurately can snow removal requests be anticipated to facilitate early and proactive administrative responses?

The goal is to identify a real world policy task of allocating public service provisions within the City of Pittsburgh, conducts EDA with a purpose for ML clustering on the City of Pittsburgh's 311 Data, and reports experiences, observations, and recommendations. The project contains both a time series forecast and clustering analysis. The aim of the time series forecast is to support planning for spikes in complaints like snow/ice removal. The aim of the clustering analysis is to identify and monitor areas with chronic or high-volume service needs.

# 311_Data EDA File
This file cleans the 311 data, conducts feature discovery, variance thresholding, and principal component analysis for clustering, and performs k-means clustering on the data.

# Requirements to Run Project Files
Please refer to the requirements.txt for installing the necessary Python libraries.
