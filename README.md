# Machine_Learning_For_Public_Policy_Adding_Value_Project
Authors: Mburu Kagiri, Alice Lyu, Chris Strehl, Ashna Patel

# Objective
This project identifies a real world policy task of allocating public service provisions within the City of Pittsburgh, conducts EDA with a purpose for ML clustering on the City of Pittsburgh's 311 Data, and reports experiences, observations, and recommendations. The project contains both a time series forecast and clustering analysis. The aim of the time series forecast is to support planning for spikes in complaints like snow/ice removal. The aim of the clustering analysis is to identify and monitor areas with chronic or high-volume service needs.

# 311_Data EDA File
This file cleans the 311 data, conducts feature discovery, variance thresholding, and principal component analysis for clustering, and performs k-means clustering on the data.

# Requirements to Run Project Files
Please refer to the requirements.txt for installing the necessary Python libraries.
